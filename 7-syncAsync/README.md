# Synchronous and Asynchronous Systems

A project demonstrating the difference between synchronous and asynchronous systems using Go and the Asynq library.

## Features

- **Synchronous System:** A simple synchronous system that prints a series of messages in order.
- **Asynchronous System:** An asynchronous system that uses the Asynq library to create a task queue where tasks are processed asynchronously.
- **Task Queue Application:** An application that processes tasks created in the asynchronous system.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Redis server:** You need to have Redis running on your local machine. If you're using Docker, you can start a Redis instance using the command `docker run --name some-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis`.

2. **Start the task queue application:** Navigate to the `task_queue` directory and run `go run main.go`.

3. **Start the asynchronous system:** In another terminal, navigate to the `asynchronous` directory and run `go run main.go`. This will enqueue three tasks to print messages.

4. **Check the task queue state:** You can use the Asynq CLI tool to inspect the state of your task queues. Install it with `go get -u github.com/hibiken/asynq/tools/asynq` and then run `asynq stats` to see the stats.

## Dependencies

- This project relies on the [Asynq](https://github.com/hibiken/asynq) library to create a task queue for the asynchronous system.
- It also uses the [Redis](https://redis.io/) in-memory data structure store as a backend for the Asynq library.

## Logs

Here are the logs of the current project:

**Terminal 1:**

```bash
# Navigate to the task queue directory:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ cd 7-syncAsync/taskQueue
# Build the Go application:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ go build -o taskQueue
# Run the task queue application:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ ./taskQueue

**Terminal 2:**

```bash
# Navigate to the asynchronous directory:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ cd 7-syncAsync/asynchronous
# Build the Go application:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ go build -o asynchronous
# Run the asynchronous system:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync/taskQueue (main) $ ./asynchronous
```

**Terminal 3:**

```bash
# Check the task queue state:
gitpod /workspace/gobox/7-syncAsync (main) $ asynq stats

```

## Usage

You should see the messages being printed in the terminal where the task queue application is running. The tasks are processed one by one, with a delay of one second between each task due to the `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)` line in the handler function.
